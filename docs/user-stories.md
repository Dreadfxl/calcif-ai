# User Stories (Design Requirements)

## General
- As a user, want a bold brutalist interface that feels powerful and functional.
- As a user, want neon highlights and metallic effects reminiscent of early 2000s digital aesthetics.
- As a user, want geometric dog bone icons matching the visual language.
- As a user, want monospace fonts and grid patterns that feel cyber and technical.
- As a user, want thick borders, hard shadows, and hierarchical structure.
- As a user, want a concrete-textured background for authenticity.

## Task Management (MVP)
- As a user, want auto-classification when creating tasks (use Gemini API if possible).
- As a user, want fallback/manual mode if low confidence.
- As a user, want glitch and neon animation feedback for classification events.
- As a user, want to assign buckets with custom geometric icons and neon palettes.
- As a user, want completion marked by animated dog bone icons and particle bursts.
